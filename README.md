Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  They wanted to have an app that was secure on the web. I updated the files and added a hash as well as a cert to make sure the server was secure.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I think I was able to figure out the keystore and certification problems that I was having early one, pretty quickly. Not super duper, but faster than I thought and it works just as well as any other other part of the server security.
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Figuring out why my certs weren't working was annoying, but when I finally figured it out I think it was good that it took so long. If it was easy and I did it right away or I just quit I wouldn't have figured out how to fix it in the future.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I made sure that all the dependencies were updated or made to be at the right version. This took out all but two vulnerabilites, which were newer and didn't seem to have a fix even after the updates. I'll definetly use the dependecy check to make sure I am not using old APIs. I'll also try to make sure that my information is hashed too.
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ran the initial vulnerability check and then as I refactored I checked to make sure I was going in the right direction, then at the end I checked again. I kept it up until I was able to find the way to get the least vulnerabilites, most if not all were just updates.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I feel like this is the same question as the ones above. This is really repetitive, aren't we supposed to be coders? lol I'm just kidding:
  I used the Maven vulnerability dependency, which scanned my program and the other dependencies to check if they were vulnverable. I also hashed my data so it was more secure online. I did that inside the files, it was to be made sure it was secure before starting the server with tests.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  My ability to get work done under pressure in a short amount of time, my creativity, and my communication.
